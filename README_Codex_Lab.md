# Codex Lab - Marcia Sousa

This repository contains experiments, tests, and projects developed using OpenAI's Codex, with a focus on programming learning and support for the CS50x 2025 course.

## Goals

- Explore code generation from natural language prompts
- Document useful use cases for Codex
- Apply CS50x concepts with the support of AI
- Develop personal software projects and automations

## Structure

- `/experiments`: Exploratory tests with Codex prompts and responses
- `/cs50x`: Applications of Codex to CS50x-inspired problems (without violating academic honesty)
- `/projects`: Personal projects supported by Codex
- `/notes`: Personal observations, tips, and prompt examples
